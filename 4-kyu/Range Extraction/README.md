## Instructions

A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either


- individual integers
- or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example ("12, 13, 15-17")


Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

Example:

~~~
solution([-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20])
# returns "-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"
~~~

## Sample Tests

### Python
~~~ python
Test.describe("Sample Test Cases")

Test.it("Simple Tests")
Test.assert_equals(solution([-6,-3,-2,-1,0,1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,17,18,19,20]), '-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20')
Test.assert_equals(solution([-3,-2,-1,2,10,15,16,18,19,20]), '-3--1,2,10,15,16,18-20')
